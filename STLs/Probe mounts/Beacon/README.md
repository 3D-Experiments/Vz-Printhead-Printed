Beacon Sensor needs to be between 2mm and 2.6mm from the nozzle tip. So you will have to print your scalable fan duct spacer/standoffs with the correct heigh depending on your hotend

## Below are the lenght of spacers to print according to hotend. BUT, it is always best to measure with your current setup because nozzle sizes may/will be different than the cad version depending on the brand/type used. 


| Hotend | Spacer lenght  |
| ------ | ----           |
|Goliath long version (Goliath with it's heatsink)| 21.15mm |
|Rapido HF|  not compatble (unless the hotend universal adapter plate is thicker to lower the hotend)|
|Rapido UHF| 14.5mm |
|Dragon with crazy NV volcano| not compatible (Unless you add the UHV v6 adapter (then use 16mm) or hotend universal adapter plate is thicker to lower the hotend) |
|Magnum+| 18mm |
